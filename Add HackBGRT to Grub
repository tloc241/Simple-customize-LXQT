- After you running setup.exe choose I option 
(Optional: To check if it had added to EFI folder or not {if your EFI drive dont show up} you have to install AOMEI wizard)
- After making EFI drive visable and you check that if already have `loader.efi`
- Now you can boot back to your linux distrobution
- Install grub customizer (sudo nala install -y grub-customizer)(yay -S grub-customizer)
- Add a new custom boot one
- In boot sequence just copy all in original windows one
- Change the line loader from boot/Microsoft.... to '/EFI/HackBGRT/loader.efi'
- Save it and that all done
*Note:* To change HackBGRT boot icon go to README to know more. Thanks.
