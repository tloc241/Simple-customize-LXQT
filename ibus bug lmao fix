**fix work for me on Lubuntu 22.04 with LXQT 0.17, not work on Lubuntu 24.04 LXQT 1.4 (backscreen)**
uninstall it first: sudo nala remove ibus
reinstall it back 
open session setting and go to autorun tab
name it /usr/bin/ibus-daemon
command /usr/bin/ibus-daemon -dr
just ok and close it
log out to test if it work or not (the shorcut sometime is conflict instend of super+space now it need shift+super+space to work)
